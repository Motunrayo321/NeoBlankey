## Overview

NeoBlankey is a smart, low-cost, portable neonatal care device designed to combat hypothermia in preterm and low-birth-weight infants, especially in underserved communities.
It combines thermal regulation, AI-powered health monitoring, and solar energy to provide hospital-grade neonatal care in environments where incubators and stable electricity are unavailable.

This repository contains:

* Source code for control systems, AI algorithms, and sensor integration
* Media files (designs, schematics, demos)
* Documentation & research reports
* Development updates and roadmap

---

## Key Features

* Thermal Regulation ‚Äì Peltier-based heating with PID control (¬±0.2¬∞C accuracy)
* Swaddle Design ‚Äì Comfortable, insulated blanket with integrated heating
* Energy Autonomy ‚Äì Rechargeable batteries + solar charging for off-grid use
* AI Health Monitoring ‚Äì Body temperature, SpO‚ÇÇ, movement, and CO‚ÇÇ tracking with predictive analytics
* Connectivity ‚Äì Wi-Fi/Bluetooth support, EMR integration, mobile dashboard (planned)
* Safety ‚Äì Overheating protection, buzzer alerts, auto shutoff

---

## Problem It Solves

* Neonatal hypothermia is a leading cause of infant mortality in Africa.
* Incubators are expensive, immobile, and electricity-dependent.
* Existing alternatives (cloth, hot water bottles, wax warmers) are unsafe or lack monitoring.

NeoBlankey fills this gap with an affordable, intelligent, and portable solution.
